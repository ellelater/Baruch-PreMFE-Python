Baruch Pre-MFE Python: Final Project
=====

### Structure

- Core: Key class definitions
- Simulation: Monte Carlo algorithms, including yield iteration & update
- Tests: test scripts and test data (CSV)
- ```utils.py```: utility functions e.g. decorators, calcYields
- ```waterfall.py```: waterfall algorithms

### Use
- Python version: 2.7x
- Set ```final_project``` as source folder
- Install ```numpy```
- Good to go

### Milestones
- part 1,2: ```test_part1.py``` demonstrates the functionalities of loading loans from csv,
running waterfall algorithm with loan pool, calculating metrics, and save results to csv.
- part 3: ```test_part3.py``` Runs MC simulations and converge to stable point.
